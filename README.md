## Overview

This repo contains the code used in my experiment titled  Detecting One Punch Man Heroes on Android - Google colab". In this experiment, which is available [here](https://medium.com/p/333c9d4149/edit), I went over the process of making dataset, provided instruction on how to use and modify my Colab notebook in order to train your own custom object detection model using [TensorFlow Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection) and how to deploy it in an Android device.

The project was done on TensorFlow 1.14.0

## Instructions
All this code by itself does not do anything. It must be used in combination with the Object Detection API. The report linked above has all the instructions on how to use the code alongside the API.
